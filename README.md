**TKMM-NX** is a custom operating system that combines the power of the Tears of the Kingdom Mod Manager (TKMM) with a lightweight, performance-optimized Linux environmentâ€”specifically tailored for the Nintendo Switch, based on Lakka / LibreELEC.

## Overview

TKMM-NX transforms your Nintendo Switch into a dedicated mod management console for Tears of the Kingdom. Based on industry-leading lightweight Linux distributions such as Lakka and LibreELEC, while incorporating custom adaptations to seamlessly run TKMM.

## Building TKMM OS for Switch

To build your own TKMM OS for Switch, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TKMM-Team/TKMM-NX.git
   cd TKMM-NX
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have the required toolchain installed (see the [build-basics](https://wiki.libreelec.tv/development/build-basics) and [build-advanced](https://wiki.libreelec.tv/development/build-advanced) pages on the LibreELEC wiki for details).

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y gcc make git unzip wget xz-utils bc gperf zip g++ \
        xfonts-utils xsltproc openjdk-11-jre-headless libparse-yapp-perl \
        libxml-parser-perl patchutils lzop rdfind dotnet-sdk-9.0 
   ```

3. **Build the Image:**  
   Use the provided build scripts and package definitions. For example, to build the release version run:
   ```bash
   DISTRO=TKMM TKMM_VERSION=<tag_name> PROJECT=L4T DEVICE=Switch ARCH=aarch64 make image
   ```
   For a debug build (with dotnet SDK and git installed), run:
   ```bash
   DISTRO=TKMM TKMM_VERSION=<tag_name> PROJECT=L4T DEVICE=Switch ARCH=aarch64 DEVMODE=enabled make image
   ```

4. **Installation:**  
   - Extract the .zip file from the release.
   - Copy the contents to the root of your SD card.
   - Once installed, boot your Switch into RCM mode and inject the Hekate payload.
   - Go to "More Configs" and select "TKMM".
   - Your Switch should now boot into TKMM-NX.
